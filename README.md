# Life Tables - Population Growth Simulation

A Shiny App built over a weekend during lockdown to help my brother, a post-doc at Stellenbosch university, quickly translate his lecture series into a completely online environment.

This app helps students understand population growth by simulating the data for 3 make-believe species with different characteristics. Alternatively, students can create their own species and examine the data and outputs. I built the model for the simulation and created several outputs for students to interact with.

Students have used this app to submit projects for their term result at Stellenbosch University and found it incredibly useful. Life Tables are a notoriously tricky concept to understand and also teach. I have also had feedback from other academics at the department that this interactive app has really helped their teaching of the topic.
